# **Fitness_notification**

## Project Description 
###### This project will focus on creating a more user friendly experience when signing up for fitness classes at the gym. The issue that we want to fix is having to search through an ample amount of unwanted information in order to find the class you want when it could be more accesible for the user. We will be scraping the website with fitness classes and using filters to only see the classes the user wants. We also plan to send notificaitons to the person when their desired class is posted on the website. 
## Project Goal
###### Our goal for this project is to scrape a fitness website and create the ability to favoirte certain group fitness classes. When doing so, it will eliminate the unneeded information that is provided for the end user. Our goal is to also successfully send notificaitons to the end users phone to remind them of upcoming favorited class times/dates along with notifying for canceled classes.
